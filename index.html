					<p class="moroccop">A look at the moroccan dunes, galavanting on the humps of camels. Morocco is in many ways a country apart. It nestles on the northwestern tip of Africa, separated from the rest of the continent by the towering Atlas Mountains and by the Sahara itself. 
					</p><p class="moroccop">Its climate, geography, and history are all more closely related to the Mediterranean than to the rest of Africa, and for this reason visitors are often struck by the odd sensation of having not quite reached Africa in Morocco.</p>

					<p class="moroccop">"Be greatful but never content". One thing i've always wanted one day is to own and be able to customize a super car. It's great to have goals that keep you on your purpose in life whether they be short or long-term.  
					</p><p class="moroccop">Sometimes major events happen that change your path and we forget about the things that we had wanted to accomplish. As those events pass and things change sometimes it's best to remind ourselves of what we always aspired to achieve and revisit our bucket list.</p>
